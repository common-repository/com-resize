A nice simple plugin for resizing your images. No configuration!

== Description ==

Finds images in your posts and if the image sizes specified in the tag are smaller then the images on disk, they are resized.
Also works for remote linked images.
It is so simple, it doesn't even need configuration. If it doesn't behave as excpected: mail me, or edit the source :)

It's best used with some caching plugin, so it doesn't hit the harddisk on with every image. Look at [wp-cache2](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-cache) or 
[supercache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache)


== Requirements ==
php with GD module AND/OR imagemagick

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `com_resize` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
